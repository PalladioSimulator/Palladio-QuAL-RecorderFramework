This package contains all recorder implementations. A recorder writes incoming measurements to a persistency framework. This framework is determined by the recorder's write strategy. There are two types of recorders: a raw recorder just passes the incoming raw measurements to its write strategy. Aggregation recorders in contrast may aggregate incoming data before storage. The concrete aggregation depends on the recorder implementation. Analogously, there are two types of write strategies: raw write strategies and aggregation write strategies.
